				<p>We stared Evolution Zoo because there are so many different animals in the past that you don't know the name of, as well as family names, like the family name of horses is Equidae. 
				In Evolution Zoo you can go through each of the different exhibits and learn more about your favorite animals. 
				We have gone through great measures to get some of these animals that we have here at our zoo. 
				We do offer food and drinks at various places in the zoo.</p>
				
				<p>We are located at 548 Zoo Way, Scottsville, Kentucky.
				
				<br />
				
				We recommend that you don't bring toddlers as some of our animals might act unpredictable when sudden noises occur, we don't want the staff nor the guest to be harmed in any way.</p>
				
				<p>We hope that your visit with us will be great and that you learn more about the past!</p>
